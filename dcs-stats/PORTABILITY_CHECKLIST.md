# DCS Statistics Website - Portability Checklist

This website has been designed to be 100% portable and work in any installation directory.

## ‚úÖ Portability Features

1. **Dynamic Path Detection**

   - No hardcoded absolute paths
   - Works in root (/) or any subdirectory (/stats/, /dcs-stats/, etc.)

2. **API Configuration**
   - Automatic HTTP/HTTPS protocol detection
   - No hardcoded server addresses
   - Configuration stored in `api_config.json`

3. **No External Dependencies**
   - No CDN requirements (all assets local)
   - No database required for basic operation
   - Admin panel uses file-based storage

4. **Clean Production Code**
   - All debug code removed
   - Console.log statements removed
   - Error display suppressed
   - No test files included

## üìã Installation Requirements

1. **Web Server**
   - Apache or Nginx
   - PHP 7.4 or higher
   - URL rewriting NOT required

2. **PHP Extensions**
   - curl (for API communication)
   - json
   - session

3. **Directory Permissions**
   - `site-config/data/` - writable by web server (for admin panel)
