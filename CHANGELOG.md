# üìã Changelog

All notable changes to the DCS Statistics Website Uploader project.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-28

### üîí Security Enhancements

#### Environment Variable Configuration System
**What Changed:** Added support for `.env` files and environment variables for configuration
**Why:** Storing credentials in config files is a security risk. Environment variables keep sensitive data out of version control and allow different configurations per environment without code changes.

#### Secure FTP (FTPS) Implementation
**What Changed:** Upgraded FTP connections to use FTPS with TLS encryption by default
**Why:** Plain FTP transmits credentials and data in cleartext. FTPS encrypts all communication, protecting against credential theft and data interception on networks.

#### API Rate Limiting System
**What Changed:** Implemented session-based rate limiting for all API endpoints
**Why:** Without rate limiting, APIs are vulnerable to abuse and DoS attacks. Rate limiting prevents automated attacks and ensures fair resource usage across users.

#### XSS Protection Layer
**What Changed:** Added comprehensive input sanitization and output encoding across all user inputs
**Why:** User inputs displayed without sanitization can execute malicious JavaScript, stealing user data or performing unauthorized actions. XSS protection prevents these attacks.

#### HTTP Security Headers
**What Changed:** Added Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options headers
**Why:** Modern browsers use security headers to prevent common attacks. CSP prevents XSS, X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking, and X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME confusion attacks.

#### Direct File Access Protection
**What Changed:** Added `.htaccess` rules to block direct access to JSON data files
**Why:** Direct file access could expose sensitive player data or allow unauthorized data harvesting. Access protection ensures data is only available through controlled API endpoints.

#### Input Validation Framework
**What Changed:** Implemented comprehensive input validation with character whitelisting
**Why:** Unvalidated inputs can contain malicious data or cause application errors. Validation ensures only expected data formats are processed, preventing injection attacks.

#### JSON Data Validation
**What Changed:** Added validation for NDJSON file structure and content before processing
**Why:** Malformed JSON can cause application crashes or security vulnerabilities. Validation ensures data integrity and prevents processing of corrupted or malicious data.

#### Secure Logging System
**What Changed:** Implemented structured logging with automatic rotation and sanitization
**Why:** Logs can contain sensitive information and grow infinitely. Secure logging prevents information leakage while maintaining operational visibility with manageable file sizes.

#### Path Traversal Protection
**What Changed:** Added path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
**Why:** Unchecked file paths can allow attackers to access files outside intended directories. Path validation prevents unauthorized file system access.

### üé® User Interface Improvements

#### Trophy Box Centering Fix
**What Changed:** Fixed centering of trophy boxes on pilot credits page using flexbox wrapper
**Why:** Poor visual alignment creates unprofessional appearance and bad user experience. Proper centering improves visual hierarchy and makes the interface more polished.

#### Leaderboard Trophy Integration
**What Changed:** Added top 3 trophy display to leaderboard page matching the credits page design
**Why:** Inconsistent UI elements across pages create confusion and poor user experience. Unified trophy displays provide consistent recognition of top performers.

#### CSS Code Cleanup
**What Changed:** Removed duplicate CSS rules and consolidated styling definitions
**Why:** Duplicate CSS causes maintenance issues, larger file sizes, and potential styling conflicts. Clean CSS improves performance and maintainability.

#### Comprehensive Pilot Statistics Page
**What Changed:** Built complete pilot search functionality from scratch with dynamic data fetching
**Why:** Users need detailed individual player statistics for community management and engagement. The search page provides comprehensive player profiles with all relevant data in one place.

### üìö Documentation Improvements

#### Professional README Overhaul
**What Changed:** Completely rewrote README from basic HTML list to comprehensive markdown documentation
**Why:** Poor documentation creates barriers to adoption and increases support burden. Professional documentation helps users understand, install, and maintain the system effectively.

**Key README Improvements:**
- Modern badges and visual elements for professional appearance
- Step-by-step installation guide for beginners
- Comprehensive feature breakdown with tables
- Security features documentation
- Troubleshooting section with common issues
- System architecture diagram
- API documentation and integration options

#### Enhanced File Structure Documentation
**What Changed:** Added detailed file structure overview with emojis and descriptions
**Why:** Users need to understand project organization for customization and troubleshooting. Clear structure documentation reduces confusion and support requests.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Infrastructure

#### Python Dependencies Management
**What Changed:** Added `requirements.txt` with python-dotenv dependency
**Why:** Manual dependency installation is error-prone and inconsistent across environments. Requirements files ensure all users have the same dependencies for reliable operation.

#### Git Configuration Improvements
**What Changed:** Added comprehensive `.gitignore` file to protect sensitive data
**Why:** Accidental commits of credentials or temporary files create security risks and repository pollution. Proper gitignore prevents sensitive data exposure.

#### Backward Compatibility Maintenance
**What Changed:** Ensured all security and feature updates work with existing configurations
**Why:** Breaking changes force users to reconfigure systems and can prevent updates. Backward compatibility allows seamless upgrades while improving security.

### üîß Development Workflow

#### SSH Key Management
**What Changed:** Added SSH agent configuration to `.bashrc` for automatic key loading
**Why:** Manual SSH key loading is tedious and error-prone. Automatic loading improves developer experience and reduces authentication failures.

#### Git History Sanitization
**What Changed:** Rewrote entire Git history to use consistent author identity and remove AI references
**Why:** Inconsistent commit authorship creates confusion about project ownership. Clean history improves professionalism and project credibility.

### üìä Feature Enhancements

#### Dynamic Data Fetching
**What Changed:** Implemented real-time data fetching for pilot statistics with error handling
**Why:** Static data becomes stale and users expect real-time information. Dynamic fetching ensures users always see current statistics with graceful error handling.

#### Responsive Design Improvements
**What Changed:** Enhanced mobile compatibility and responsive layouts across all pages
**Why:** Users access websites from various devices. Responsive design ensures good user experience regardless of screen size or device type.

#### Search Functionality Enhancement
**What Changed:** Improved search with loading states and comprehensive error messages
**Why:** Poor search UX frustrates users and reduces engagement. Enhanced search provides clear feedback and helps users find information effectively.
